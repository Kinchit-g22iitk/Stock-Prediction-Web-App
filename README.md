# Stock-Prediction-Web-App

Welcome to our Stock Prediction App, where we harness the power of **deep learning** models to forecast stock prices for given no of days. Our application aims to provide users with valuable insights into potential price trends, empowering them to make informed decisions in the dynamic world of stock trading.
            
### HOW IT WORKS
Our Stock Prediction App combines the prowess of deep learning techniques with historical stock price data to predict future price movements. By leveraging **Time2Vec encoding**, **Transformer encoders, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), RNN** and **Bidirectional RNN**, we create predictive models capable of capturing patterns and trends in the stock market.

### HOW IS DATA COLLECTED
To ensure accuracy and reliability, we source historical stock prices from the trusted **Yahoo Finance API**. This API enables us to access stock market data, including price histories, trading volumes, and other essential financial indicators.

### HOW IS DATA PREPROCESSED
Before feeding the data into our deep learning models, we undertake a data preprocessing phase. During this stage, we clean the data, handle missing values, and normalize the features to ensure consistency and eliminate biases. Preprocessing plays a pivotal role in optimizing model performance and generating more precise predictions.

### MODELS USED
Our Stock Prediction App employs state-of-the-art deep learning models, including encoders, LSTM, GRU, and other cutting-edge architectures. These models are selected and fine-tuned to extract intricate temporal patterns and dependencies from historical stock price data. By combining the strengths of these models, we strive to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness.

### OUTPUT
Once the deep learning models process the historical data and learn from the underlying patterns, our Stock Prediction App generates a comprehensive forecast for the stock price over no of days user entered. Please note that while our predictions are based on historical trends and sophisticated algorithms, the stock market is inherently volatile and subject to various external factors. As such, we urge users to use the predictions as supplementary information and exercise their own judgment when making investment decisions.
